/**@brief Get an event from the pending events queue.
 *
 * @param[in] p_dest Pointer to buffer to be filled in with an event, or NULL to retrieve the event length. This buffer <b>must be 4-byte aligned in memory</b>.
 * @param[in, out] p_len Pointer the length of the buffer, on return it is filled with the event length.
 *
 * @details This call allows the application to pull a BLE event from the BLE stack. The application is signalled that an event is 
 * available from the BLE Stack by the triggering of the SWI2 interrupt (mapped to IRQ 22).
 * The application is free to choose whether to call this function from thread mode (main context) or directly from the Interrupt Service Routine
 * that maps to SWI2. In any case however, and because the BLE stack runs at a higher priority than the application, this function should be called
 * in a loop (until @ref NRF_ERROR_NOT_FOUND is returned) every time SWI2 is raised to ensure that all available events are pulled from the stack. 
 * Failure to do so could potentially leave events in the internal queue without the application being aware of this fact.
 * Sizing the p_dest buffer is equally important, since the application needs to provide all the memory necessary for the event to be copied into
 * application memory. If the buffer provided is not large enough to fit the entire contents of the event, @ref NRF_ERROR_DATA_SIZE will be returned
 * and the application can then call again with a larger buffer size.
 * Please note that because of the variable length nature of some events, sizeof(ble_evt_t) will not always be large enough to fit certain events, 
 * and so it is the application's responsability to provide an amount of memory large enough so that the relevant event is copied in full.
 * The application may "peek" the event length by providing p_dest as a NULL pointer and inspecting the value of *p_len upon return.
 *
 * @return @ref NRF_SUCCESS If an event has been pulled.
 * @return @ref NRF_ERROR_NOT_FOUND If no events are ready to be pulled.
 * @return @ref NRF_ERROR_DATA_SIZE If no event did not fit in the application provided buffer
